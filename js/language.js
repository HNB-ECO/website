Below are some of its use cases:<p>1) Agriculture: Agriculture businesses can migrate to the HNB community to better manage their product inventory, control vendor disputes, and decrease the number of intermediaries seeking middleman fees for payments. This will lower the cost of business expenses and enable smoother business commerce and transactions.<p>2) Brand Protection: Brands can use the HNB platform to ensure that counterfeit products are not purchased. This is achieved by enabling payments via the HNB platform. Brands will save significant amounts of money by having their brands protected by the HNB platform.<p>3) Global Trade: Import and export companies can use the HNB network to reduce friction in international commerce and encourage higher economic growth. Secure transactions on the HNB network can be completed instantaneously, even across borders.<p>The HNB platform can integrate with a broad range of businesses. We expect it will touch almost all types of businesses in many regions around the globe."
