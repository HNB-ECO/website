In the underlying infrastructure of the blockchain world, the public chain has always served a service-supporting role for business applications. Such a role means strong performance support, but it is difficult to break the spell by looking at the existing public chain. As a result, current public chain technologies iterate continuously to provide actual commercial applications.

The HNB public chain, as a latecomer, is trying to integrate into the world in a more effective way.

Trade value belongs to all ecosystem participants

As a public chain, HNB is very practical. The vision of the founding team is to develop a new economy, which acts as the connecting center of the physical world and the blockchain world, to build a multi-centered economy across national borders and realms, and to realize free trade. The value created by trade should belong to every ecosystem participants.

Ken, CEO of HNB, is a partner of Probe Angel and Mai Teng Fund. He has worked in IT, Internet and investment for more than 20 years and has rich practical experience. His participation in the creation of Asilinco (SAAS service) was acquired by listed companies, and iSoftStone (software outsourcing) was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and most other projects grew healthily. Perhaps due to the investor's innate business sense, Li Kan believes that blockchain technology can change the current centralized trading system. He was quickly convinced by blockchain technology and deeply recognized the spiritual world constructed by blockchain technology.

Prior to joining HNB, HNB co-founder Mark Trelevean directed and built large systems for Forbes Fortune 500 companies in multiple countries. Mark has always been at the forefront of new technology, allowing him to have early exposure to blockchain technology. In early 2016, Mark returned from Consensus, New York, to attend the Global Architects and Technical Standards Council. Few people talked about blockchain technology and saw the upcoming changes in blockchain technology. At this time, Mark wrote a detailed proposal on the blockchain, which was very well received at the conference.

At the beginning of 2017, Mark and co-founder Alan Wu really started to get in touch with blockchain technology. The two co-founders invited Ken to join HNB and worked with several other founders to establish the HNB public chain. They firmly believe that the blockchain will change the way transactions are handled in the future, and Distributed Autonomous Organizations will be a new model for future business.

As a result, the HNB community established the All Community Member Conference (GMH), with policies and decisions voted by multi-centered participants, smart contract execution, and no human intervention. Major issues are discussed and voted by all community members, and the GMH-authorized full-time councils (Development Council, Reserve Council, Arbitration Council) perform their respective functions. 

Dual-token design

Since the concept of blockchain technology became so popular in China during 2017, countless blockchain-related projects started to appear, causing a bubble in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. Many projects leveraged blockchain technology without offering intrinsic value. Token valuations became too large without real corresponding economic support. As a result, the fund is discouraged, the project is difficult to move, and the industry winter comes early.

Of course, accelerating the conclusion of the industry's winter season is not purely related to too few quality projects, but also the general community pays too much attention to token prices. The underlying technology of the public chain is not too hard to understand, and the difficulty to load the current trading demand is also one of the important factors for the industry to move forward.

The awareness of the HNB team foresaw these developmental flaws. The HNB solution design includes a dual-chain dual-token architecture. The sidechain can handle transactions from the main chain, effectively relieving the main chain pressure to improve performance and allow for high concurrency.

Ecosystem builders can build their own sidechains to communicate with the main chain and be able to mortgage main chain assets to issue custom digital assets. The side chain and the main chain forward the transaction to the other party through the relay gateway, realizing the transaction consistency of the cross-chain transactions. The underlying platform will provide a gateway module for the docking of the sidechains with the main chain.

The dual token mechanism means that in the HNB ecosystem, HNB is the asset token, which is the equity certificate of the entire HNB economy. HGS is the circulation token, which is linked to the US dollar as the payment medium for transactions and circulates in the economy. HNB and HGS are native assets in the system, and the remaining digital assets are recorded as account balances.

HNB uses a dual dual-token architecture to solve the most important assets and payment-winding problems in the real economy, and promotes the continuous creation and precipitation of labor value through token circulation.

Hybrid consensus mechanism

On the technical level, due to the pursuit of technology by the HNB founding team, a hybrid consensus mechanism for speed and security is created.

HNB positioning is based on the Algorand + DPoS hybrid consensus mechanism for a high TPS, high-security public chain. The hybrid mechanism first uses the identity attribute to perform DPoS election, which can select nodes with better performance and fairness, avoiding the situation of a single group taking advantage of the system; the process of selecting the accounting node is through generating random numbers through the algorand algorithm. The consensus is achieved quickly, and the speed will not slow down as the number of nodes increases. The HNB solution is scalable, and does not make meaningless calculations under the premise of ensuring security, saving computing resources.

In addition, the bookkeepers are completely random. After completing the bookkeeping, the Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm is used to establish consensus among the proposers. The HNB BA* algorithm uses multiple rounds of interaction to ensure absolute consistency of the final proposed block among the proposers. Voting must be greater than 2/3 to enter the next process, ensuring that there are no issues such as consensus partitioning and block forking. This will avoid targeted attacks like those found in pure DPoS consensus models. 

Under this hybrid mechanism, the candidate accounting node is chosen by DPoS first, and the specific accounting node is randomly selected by using the algorand in the candidate node, and the consensus speed does not slow down as the number of nodes and transactions increase. In the case of a large increase, it can also ensure efficient scalability.

In addition, in the cross-chain interaction of the HNB main side chain already mentioned in the above dual-chain design, there are actually two cases of the side chain application scenario of HNB, one is the dual-chain double-generation currency of the two original assets of HNB and HGS. Cross-chain interaction can also take place when merchants establish their own sidechains through the relevant SDKs due to business needs, and need to communicate with the main chain after distributing their own digital assets.

The HNB underlying blockchain system solves these two scenarios by using three types of cross-chain interactions: notary public, side chain/relay, and other third-party protocols.

The notary mechanism is used to support cross-chain transactions between two native digital assets within HNB. The partial centralization mechanism handles the cross-chain transaction request for one of the assets identified by the notary and the corresponding processing on the other digital asset. HNB and HGS are two digital assets managed by the HNB community. The HNB community acts as a notary public and can effectively manage exchange transactions between two assets. At the same time, in this way, higher cross-chain transaction throughput can be supported.

The Extensible Third Party Agreement is an agreement for asset transactions between HNB digital assets and other third party blockchains. The HNB team believes that the future blockchain architecture will be a chain structure composed of multiple blockchains, and cross-chain interaction is an inevitable trend. Therefore, the bottom layer of the HNB blockchain will reserve a third-party cross-chain protocol interface for future expansion when docked with other blockchains.
