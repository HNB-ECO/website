The HNB solution consists of a dual-chain, dual-token architecture. The side chain can handle transactions from the main chain, removing network congestion and improving the performance of the HNB main chain.
Enterprises can integrate their own side chains to allow for the issuance of new digital assets interchangeable with the HNB main chain. The side chain and the main chain forward the transaction to the other party, achieving transaction consistency for cross-chain transactions.
Within the HNB ecosystem, the HNB token is the digital asset representing ownership of the HNB economic entity, while HGS is the stable token that is pegged to a USD value and will be used as the payment medium on the HNB network.
Hybrid Consensus Algorithm of DPoS and Algorand
The HNB solution is based on the DPoS and Algorand consensus algorithm for a high-TPS, high-security public chain. The hybrid mechanism uses the identity attribute to perform DPoS election. Nodes will be selected with better performance and fairness, avoiding the situation of a single group taking advantage of the system. The process of selecting the accounting node is through generation of random numbers through the Algorand algorithm. Consensus between nodes is achieved quickly, and the speed will not slow down as the number of nodes increase. The HNB solution is scalable and does not make meaningless calculations under the premise of ensuring security, which saves computing resources.
Bookkeepers are selected at random. After completing the bookkeeping, the Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm is used to establish consensus among the proposers. The algorithm uses multiple rounds of interaction to ensure absolute consistency of the final proposed block among the proposers. The vote must be greater than 2/3 to enter the next process, ensuring that there are no issues such as consensus partitioning and block forking. This will avoid targeted attacks like those found in pure DPoS consensus models.
Under this hybrid mechanism, the candidate accounting node is chosen by DPoS first, and the specific accounting node is randomly selected by using the Algorand consensus algorithm for the candidate node. The consensus speed does not slow down as the number of nodes and transactions increase. In the case of a large increase, it can also ensure efficient scalability.
In the cross-chain interaction of the HNB main side chain, there are two cases of the side chain application of HNB. The first case is the dual-chain currency generation of the HNB and HGS assets. Cross-chain interaction can also take place when merchants establish their own side chains through the relevant SDKs due to business needs, and need to communicate with the main chain for distributing their own digital assets.
The HNB Ecosystem
The HNB wallet is the key to unlock the HNB ecosystem. We launched the wallet in early August to a small group of loyal users, and as of today, we have 15,000 members using the wallet.
User adoption is one of the challenges that the blockchain industry is facing, so we have designed the wallet with the customer’s experience in mind. Log in to the wallet to view your HNB, HGS and ETH balances in your Ethereum wallet, join the HNB academy to learn more about blockchain technology and the HNB ecosystem, try your luck with the HNB DICE game to win HGS or make your first e-commerce purchase through the Uncle Bull(好麦) store in the HNB ecosystem — the options are endless!
